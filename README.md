# MaMBa-Project
The files from the MaMBa-project at Chalmers University of Technology - A project about measuring and modelling ball sense
There are 12 exercises that you can do with the iOS-app and some extra equipment explained in the files.

Droppboll - an exercise that drops a ping pong ball from a pipe and then the ball should be placed in another pipe with a racket as fast as possible
Balansboll - balance a ball for as long as possible on a bat. The ball will sense when it dropps.
Kinect (Fast Turns) - a Kinect camera detects colours and measures the time it takes to move a (red) ball between two (green) lines on the floor.
