# MaMBa-Project
The files from the MaMBa-project at Chalmers University of Technology - A project about measuring and modelling ball sense.
There are 12 exercises that you can do with the iOS-app (search for 'fredrik beiron MaMBa' on the AppStore) and you will need to build some extra equipment explained in the instruction files to do some of the exercises. 

Appen - This directory contains all the files used to create the app

Balansboll - balance a ball for as long as possible on a bat. The ball will sense when it is dropped.

Databehandling - Jupyter Notebook (Python) code to manipulate the data from our app into a better format

Droppboll - an exercise that drops a ping pong ball from a pipe and then the ball should be placed in another pipe with a racket as fast as possible.

Kinect (Fast Turns) - a Kinect camera detects colours and measures the time it takes to move a (red) ball between two (green) lines on the floor.
